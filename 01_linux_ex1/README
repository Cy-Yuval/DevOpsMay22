Kernel System Calls
-------------------
# whatIdo (strace)
Creates subdir in the current dir "./welcomeToDevOpsMay22".
Opens/creates file "goodLuck" in dir "welcomeToDevOpsMay22/goodLuck".
Writes some text there: "There you go... tell me what I do".
Then closes connection and exits.

Broken Symlink
-------------------
# Original commands
FILENAME=backup-$(date +"%d-%m-%Y").obj
touch $FILENAME
echo "backup data..." >> $FILENAME
ln -s $FILENAME backup.obj
mkdir backup
mv backtest/backup.obj backup

Problem: backup.obj will not work after moving to another directory because it relates to the relative path.
Solution: create an absolute path with command: ln -s /tmp/test/$FILENAME backup.obj

Binary Numbers
--------------
1. Convert the following binary numbers to a decimals:
111, 100, 10110
7, 4, 22
2. What is the available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number?
0-255
3. Given a 9 bits binary number, suggest a method to represent a negative numbers between 0-255
111111111
4. Suggest a method to represent a floating point numbers (e.g. 12.3,  15.67, 0.231) using a 8 bits binary numbers
The 1st bit will represtent the sign of the number (- \ +), then the next 4 bits will represent the exponent + 7 and the last 3 bits will represent the mantissa (the numbers after the decimal point)
