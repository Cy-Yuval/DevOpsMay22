# Git Basics (commit, diff, branches)

1. touch abc.txt && echo 1 >> abc.txt .
2. the color is red and the file is in untracked state (hes not part of the git repo yet).
3. we will use 'git add' to add the file into the index (the color is green) , 'git commit' to commit the changes
4. echo 2 >> abc.txt
5. the color is red like in step 2 but the change is the state of the file in step 2 it was in untracked area and now it is in tracked area
6. git diff
7. 'git diff --staged' show the difference between the staged (tracked) changed and the ones committed on the repo
 because we didnt added the changes yet with 'git add' there is no difference between the index and the repo yet.
8. the error we are getting is fatal: ambitious argument cant find rev or path
 and we are getting this error because there is no file named staged2 or tag named staged2.
 git dont know to what he need to compare the changes because the file/tag doesnt exist.
9. git add abc.txt
10. git diff shows empty window because we added the changes to the index in section 9 and git diff show changes between working tree and the repository
 if we want it to compare changes between the index and the repository we need to use 'git diff --staged'.
11. git diff main (git diff <branch we want to check on> )
