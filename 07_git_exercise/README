4.echo "2" >> abc.txt
5. There are no different in the colors both are Red | The difference is when we created the file the git status alerting that
the file need to be added -- and after committing the file it is alerting that the file has been modified
6. git diff
7. it is not printing anything because the file abc.txt currently in the working tree if the file was committed it would have
shown.

11.  the command is : git diff --staged abc.txt:
12 .echo "3" >> abc.txt
13.it may appear on the first glance that it is the same output but no
