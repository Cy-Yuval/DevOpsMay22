# Git Basics (commit, diff, branches)

1.echo 1 > abc.txt
2.git status = red
3.git add abc.txt ### git status = green ### git commit ### git status = nothing to commit
4.echo 2 >> abc.txt
5.git status = red = same as step 2 because before git add - the file is in working tree and not in index - red=working tree local green=index
6.git diff
7.git diff --staged will only print changes between index tree and main/master tree, In this case the changes to file is still in working tree
8.The command refers to stage2 as a revision or a path that doesn't really exist, adding '--' is needed to separate paths and revisions
9.git add abc.txt ### git status = green
10.git diff will only shows differences between the file in the working tree and the same file in index before committing changes
11.git diff --staged (here you cand add a specific file or leave empty for total differences)
12.echo 3 >> abc.txt
13.not the same output - the reason is git main print differences between main and working tree, git --staged print diff between index and main, in this case the append is not yet committed to main repo
14.to let you know that the file is different between working tree and index
15.git reset --hard
