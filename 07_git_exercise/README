7.using git diff --staged It doesnt show any changes because the file abc.txt is in working tree
8.diff stage2 return fatal error because stage 2 in unknown path and it is not in the working tree and we sould use the separator -- before.
9.git add abc.txt git status = green
10.git diff print nothing because all of the changes as been commented
11.git diff --staged
12.echo 3 >> abc.txt
13.not the same output because the git diff shows the different between the working area to the staging area.
